Other benefits of screening potential personnel  include helping to ensure workplace safety and  confirming information provided by prospective  employees on their resumes. Good Practice Entities should consider screening for existing  personnel anytime they transfer into roles where  they have access to the CDE from roles where  they did not have this access.  To be effective, the level of screening should be  appropriate for the position. For example,  positions requiring greater responsibility or that  have administrative access to critical data or  systems may warrant more detailed or more  frequent screening than positions with less  responsibility and access. Examples Screening options can include, as appropriate for  the entity's region, previous employment history,  review of public information\/social media  resources, criminal record, credit history, and  reference checks. |\n| 12.7.1 Potential personnel who will have access to  the CDE are screened, within the constraints of  local laws, prior to hire to minimize the risk of  attacks from internal sources.                                                                                                                                                                              | 12.7.1 Interview responsible Human Resource  department management to verify that screening is  conducted, within the constraints of local laws,  prior to hiring potential personnel who will have  access to the CDE.","document.id":"c89de09b-e122-4e5e-a9f6-28880b7f1dfa","document.score":0.0561841565},{"document.content":"Description: index of PCI DSS v4 standards, Content: # Options For Tpsps To Validate Pci Dss Compliance For Tpsp Services That Meet Customers' Pci Dss Requirements\n\n<h2>Options For Tpsps To Validate Pci Dss Compliance For Tpsp Services That Meet Customers' Pci Dss Requirements<\/h2>\n<p>TPSPs are responsible for demonstrating their PCI DSS compliance as requested by organizations that manage compliance programs (for example, payment brands and acquirers).
